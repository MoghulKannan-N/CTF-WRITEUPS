Challenge: Esoteric

Category: Forensics / Steganography

Overview

The challenge involved a multi-stage hidden data extraction process. The initial artifact was a password-protected ZIP archive that, once cracked, revealed an image file. This image contained steganographically embedded data which ultimately led to a dictionary file holding fragmented flag components. Reconstructing these fragments produced the final flag.

Step 1 — Cracking the ZIP archive

The provided archive was encrypted. A hint suggested the password:

cr@ck_m3

Extraction was performed with:

unzip images.zip

After entering the password, an image file was extracted:

image.jpeg
Step 2 — Steganographic extraction from the image

The image was analyzed using steghide to identify and extract hidden embedded content.

steghide extract -sf image.jpeg

This produced a hidden file:

dict.txt
Step 3 — Understanding the extracted data

The dict.txt file contained mappings between unusual words and partial flag segments. Each line associated a sample word with a fragment of the final flag.

Typical structure examples:

zillo = L{
mittai = O
...

The full flag was split across multiple lines.

Step 4 — Reconstructing the flag automatically

To extract only the meaningful flag fragments and concatenate them in sequence:

sed 's/.*[=:]//' dict.txt | tr -d ' \n'

This removed the word identifiers and merged all fragments into a single continuous string, revealing the complete flag.

Conclusion

The challenge demonstrated a layered forensics workflow:

Breaking archive encryption using a hinted password

Identifying and extracting steganographic payloads with steghide

Analyzing structured hidden data

Automating reconstruction of fragmented secrets
