Silent Trust – Boot2Root Write-Up
Challenge Intro

Name: Silent Trust
Category: Boot2Root / Linux
Difficulty: Medium
Author: Astra

This challenge simulates a real-world Linux environment where security failures stem from implicit trust in automation and boot-time assumptions, rather than obvious vulnerabilities or weak credentials. No public exploits were required; success depended on understanding Linux trust boundaries.

Initial Access

The provided VM booted normally to a TTY login prompt. Supplied credentials (devops / devops) failed for interactive login, and no network services (SSH/HTTP) were accessible. This indicated that direct user login was intentionally restricted, shifting focus to non-interactive trust paths.

Root Access – Bootloader Trust Abuse

During boot, GRUB was accessible and not password protected. By editing the kernel boot parameters and appending:

init=/bin/bash


the system booted directly into a root shell before PAM and authentication were enforced. The root filesystem was then remounted read-write, granting full root access.

The root flag was retrieved from:

/root/root.flag


Root Flag:

SECE{capabilities_are_stronger_than_passwords}


This demonstrated that boot-time trust overrides all user authentication controls.

User → Root Escalation via Capabilities

Post-analysis of user artifacts revealed a trusted automation binary:

/usr/local/bin/ci-runner


Inspection showed it had the Linux capability:

cap_setuid=ep


When executed as the devops user, this binary spawned a root shell without sudo or a password. This represented the intended user-level privilege escalation path, abusing Linux capabilities rather than misconfigured sudo.

Further enumeration of CI-related residue uncovered a hidden user flag at:

/home/devops/.cache/.ci/user.flag


User Flag:

SECE{trust_is_the_first_vulnerability}
