1. Binary identification

Use file to confirm the executable is a 64-bit ELF.

checksec shows no packing or obfuscation protections.

2. Input handling

The program reads user input from standard input.

A strict length check of 18 characters is applied.

Any input not matching this length is rejected immediately.

3. Validation loop

After passing the length check, the program processes the input byte-by-byte inside a loop.

Each character is transformed before comparison.

4. Transformation logic

For each input byte in, the following operation is performed:

out = ((in ^ edx) + esi) ^ edi


Initial register values:

edx = 0x0d

esi = -17

edi = 0x5a

Register updates per iteration:

edx += 7

esi -= 3

edi += 2

5. Comparison

The transformed byte out is compared against a fixed byte array stored in .rodata.

A single mismatch causes the program to print Wrong flag.

6. Reversing the check

The transformation is reversible.

Inverting the logic gives:

in = ((out ^ edi) - esi) ^ edx


Applying this to all 18 bytes recovers the original input.

7. Verification

Supplying the recovered string to the binary results in Correct!.
